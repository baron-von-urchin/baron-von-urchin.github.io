<font size = "5"> My name is Pike Spector and I'm passionate about marine science, phycology, conservation, restoration, and open data science. Trained in kelp forest ecology, I have a Masters of Science in Biology from San Diego State University, and a Bachelors of Science in Marine Biology from UC Santa Cruz. I'm currently on "sabbatical" right now, but very soon I'll be starting an exciting new position with a great agency in my home state of California. Stay tuned for more updates!
